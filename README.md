Simple exploration into using Electron to build a browser.

The code uses examples from many different places, but the foundation was started from a set of posts from Paul Frazee:

* http://pfraze.github.io/2015/09/08/building-electron-browser-pt1.html
* https://github.com/pfraze/electron-browser

## Build

### Dependencies

```
brew install node --with-full-icu
npm install --global gulp-cli
```

Everytime update from the git repository you may need to install or update any new node dependencies:
```
npm install
```

### Tasks

The following `gulp` tasks are implemented.

* `run` - Runs the build. Builds the client/renderer code via webpack in `production` mode. Should be rather similar to a packaged build.
* `run-dev` - Runs the build in `development` with hot module reloading via webpack.
* `package` - Creates a distributable package. **Currently broken**. But closer to working.

The following tasks will most likely not need to be used externally, but as dependencies.

* `electron-download` - Downloads a target of electron to use. Should automatically be called after the first `npm install`, so shouldn't be needed.
* `clean-package` - Removes `./dist` directory.
* `build` - Builds the client/renderer code.
* `build-dev` - Builds the client/renderer code in development mode.

## Testing

Currently just eslint tests.

```
npm test
```
